## MyReads Book Library
**"myReads"** is a _React_ app in which users can categorise books as 'read', 'currently reading' and 'wants to read'. The categorised books will be displayed on front page. Users can search for books and can add books to their list.

## Getting Started
When the app is loaded, it will display 7 books _by default_. User can click on the green colored drop-down button on bottom-right corner of every book to change the category of book as 'read', 'currently reading' and 'wants to read'.
